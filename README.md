## What's MDC?

With the further development of technology and the awakening of user awareness, 
privacy protection is gaining more and moreattention. As collectors and analysts 
of big data, it is necessary to strictly abide by relevant laws and regulations and 
fully consider user rights and social influences.

MagicData (Magic Data) Chain is committed to solving the dilemma of privacy and convenience , 
MDC project to block chain well chain technology as the foundation, will be distributed edge 
computing, intelligent contracts, deduplication and other storage encryption technology integration, 
well-designed financial load Mathematical model, software and hardware combination to provide users with 
the most secure and reliable, data storage, use, financing and otherservices .

In traditional networks, user data is collected directly by the centralization 
organization and used for commercial purposes. This collection is sometimes 
authorized by the user, but currently more is collected and used without the user's knowledge.

MDC team by building a distributed storage, tamper-proof and absolutely safe data link network of public , private users to key the EU
data entirely in their own hands, no one else can privately view , can achieve secure storage of user data , calculation, transmission.

In the MDC network, any data that can be collected is authorized by the user and cannot be tampered with on the blockchain, 
which greatly improves the authenticity of the data. On the one hand, the data provided by the user indicates that the user 
does have strong subjective requirements. These data are more accurate and accurate for precision marketing. On the other hand, 
the characteristics of the blockchain ensure that the data cannot be tampered, greatly reducing the possibility of data fraud. 
Sexuality makes the data more informative.

In addition, users can also by private key to data licensed to companies, to provide users with personalized service; 
and the traditional network is different, this part of the revenue generated data, it will be returned to the user.

The MDC network feeds back the benefits generated by user data to the user, not only the recognition of the value of the user's data, 
but also greatly enhances the sustainability of the connection with the user. The user will regain control over his or her own data 
and the value of the data, becoming the true owner of his data.

The MDC network allows the value of data to return to users, and establishes an equal, healthy and sustainable relationship with users,
which not only benefits users, but also contributes to the long-term development of the MDC network itself and the realization of the vision of MDC to build a new economy .
We hope , users can self- determine their every click, every photo, every act. We hope that users can decide for themselves whether this data is their own secret or can be used to make the world a better place. 
We hope that privacy will not be violated, that technology is no longer used to do evil , and that data can generate real value for the owner of the data.


# How to Build

## Prepare dependencies

* JDK 1.8
* On Linux Ubuntu system (e.g. Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS), ensure that the machine has [__Oracle JDK 8__](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04), instead of having __Open JDK 8__ in the system. 
* **MINIMUM** 2 ENERGY Cores


## Use Git

In the shell command, type:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MagicDataDev/MagicData-Chain.git
git checkout -t origin/master
```


## Building from source code

* Build in the Terminal

```bash
cd MagicData-Chain
./gradlew build
```


* Build in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/):

  **Please run ./gradlew build once to build the protocol files**

  1. Start IntelliJ. Select `File` -> `Open`, then locate to the java-tron folder which you have git cloned to your local drive. Then click `Open` button on the right bottom.
  2. Check on `Use auto-import` on the `Import Project from Gradle` dialog. Select JDK 1.8 in the `Gradle JVM` option. Then click `OK`.
  3. IntelliJ will open the project and start gradle syncing, which will take several minutes, depending on your network connection and your IntelliJ configuration
  4. Enable Annotations, `Preferences` -> Search `annotations` -> check `Enable Annotation Processing`.
  5. After the syncing finished, select `Gradle` -> `Tasks` -> `build`, and then double click `build` option.
  
# Running

* Use the executable JAR

```bash
java -jar MdcFullNode.jar -p your private key --witness -c your config.conf
Example:
java -jar MdcFullNode.jar -p 650950B193DDDDB35B6E48912DD28F7AB0E7140C1BFDEFD493348F02295BD812 --witness -c /data/mdc/config.conf

```
